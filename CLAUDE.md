# CLAUDE.md — Journey Ledger Project Instructions

This file is the persistent source of truth for future Claude Code sessions. Read it before making changes. Keep it current (see **Update Policy**).

## Project Identity

* This repository was started from `Nagoya_ledger`.
* The new product is **Journey Ledger**.
* The goal is to refactor from a single-trip **Nagoya 2026** planner into a general **multi-trip travel ledger**.

## Product Goal

* Each trip will eventually be a separate workspace.
* Each trip should have its own Journal, Planning Timeline, Table, Import, Events, Notes, Checklist, Weather, and Location data.
* The app should eventually support arbitrary trips, not only Nagoya.
* The most valuable features are **Journal** and **Planning**.
* Photo / base64 image features are **non-core** and should be removed or postponed in a later phase.

## Architecture Summary

* **React + TypeScript + Vite** frontend.
* **RxDB** local-first IndexedDB storage.
* **Supabase** Auth, PostgreSQL, and sync.
* **Existing core views:**
  * Journal / Overview
  * Planning Timeline
  * Table
  * Smart Import
  * Event Detail
* **Existing known risk areas:**
  * hardcoded `nagoya-2026` trip id
  * hardcoded Nagoya copy / strings
  * hardcoded `2026-01-31` to `2026-02-07` date range
  * event queries that may not yet be fully trip-scoped
  * photo / base64 image storage

## Engineering Rules

* Work in phases.
* Do not rewrite the whole app at once.
* Do not introduce unrelated UI rewrites during data-model phases.
* Preserve existing behavior unless the current phase explicitly changes it.
* Prefer explicit TypeScript types over `any`.
* All event queries must eventually be scoped by `trip_id`.
* Do not remove RxDB local-first behavior.
* Do not remove Supabase Auth.
* Do not commit secrets or environment values.
* Run `npm run build` after implementation.
* Run `npm run lint` if available.
* Run `npm test` if available.

## Phase Plan

* **Phase 0:** v2 baseline, metadata rebrand, create `CLAUDE.md`.
* **Phase 1:** add `trips` data model.
* **Phase 2:** add TripLibrary.
* **Phase 3:** add TripWorkspace.
* **Phase 4:** remove Nagoya hardcoding, make event views trip-scoped and date-driven.
* **Phase 5:** UI/UX rebrand and remove photo UI.
* **Phase 6:** quota, tests, RLS documentation, and release cleanup.

## Phase Status

Current phase: Phase 2 — add TripLibrary

Completed:
- **Phase 0 — v2 baseline.** Metadata rebranded to Journey Ledger (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts` PWA manifest, `index.html` title/alt, `README.md`); `CLAUDE.md` created. Runtime behavior unchanged; single-trip behavior preserved.
  - Build/lint/test result: build passed; lint has pre-existing legacy errors only (no new errors introduced); no test script exists yet.
- **Phase 1 — `trips` data model.** Added a first-class `trips` model while preserving single-trip behavior.
  - **Persistence decision:** local-first RxDB `trips` collection + Supabase `trips` mirror table, using the same JSONB pattern as `trip_events` (`id`, `updated_at`, `deleted`, `user_id`, `data jsonb`). Trips are NOT stored inside `trip_events`; trips are NOT local-only.
  - New: `src/db/tripSchema.ts` (`Trip` type + `TRIP_SCHEMA`, version 0), `src/db/trips.ts` (`ensureLegacyTrip` upsert helper, `LEGACY_TRIP_ID`).
  - Changed: `src/db/index.ts` (register `trips` collection, start trips replication independently of events), `src/db/replication.ts` (`startTripsReplication`, fully typed), `src/App.tsx` (upsert legacy trip after DB init + auth).
  - **Legacy data:** on first load a `nagoya-2026` trip (Nagoya, Japan; 2026-01-31 → 2026-02-07; Asia/Tokyo) is upserted with `owner_id = current user`, so existing events (`trip_id = 'nagoya-2026'`) are not orphaned. Existing events were NOT rewritten.
  - **Manual Supabase action required:** apply `supabase/migrations/20260615_create_trips.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor (creates `trips` table, RLS policies, realtime publication). Until applied, trips replication logs an error and no-ops locally; event sync is unaffected. See `supabase/README.md`.
  - Build/lint/test result: build passed; lint unchanged (pre-existing legacy errors only, no new errors in touched files; new files clean); no test script.

In progress:
- Phase 2 — add TripLibrary

Next:
- Phase 3 — add TripWorkspace

## Architecture Changes (running log)

- **Phase 1:** Second RxDB collection `trips` alongside `tripevents`. Independent Supabase replication channel (`trips_db_changes`, identifier `supabase-jsonb-trips-v1`). Trips replication failures are isolated from events replication. Legacy trip bootstrap runs once per load (no-op if the trip already exists locally).

## Known Risks (running log)

- **Phase 1:**
  - `trips` Supabase table must be created manually; until then cross-device trip sync does not work (local-only, no data loss).
  - RxDB dev-mode schema validation for `TRIP_SCHEMA` was not exercised in this session (the production `build` does not run runtime schema validation, and `npm run dev` requires Supabase env vars). Schema mirrors the proven `TRIP_EVENT_SCHEMA` structure; verify on first `npm run dev`.
  - Deletion semantics: trips replication maps server `deleted` → both RxDB `_deleted` and the queryable `is_deleted` field. No trip-deletion UI exists yet (Phase 2+), so this path is untested.

## Update Policy

Future Claude Code sessions **must** keep this file current. Do not let `CLAUDE.md` become stale.

When a phase is completed:
* Update the **Phase Status** section.
* Move the completed phase into **Completed**.
* Set the next phase as **Current phase**.
* Add important architecture changes.
* Add known risks and TODOs discovered during implementation.

## End-of-Phase Report Format

At the end of each phase, report using this standard format:

* Files changed
* Architecture changes
* Behavior changes
* Commands run
* Build / lint / test result
* Known risks
* TODOs for next phase
